# Beetle Small Keyboards

## Overview:

Sometimes you don't need many keys for a project, and the Arduino Beetle has 10
I/O pins plus a USB port for small projects. This combination is ideal for:

    * USB based keyboards (or mice)
    * Handwired (although PCB options are possible too)
    * One to 10 keys are trivial
    * Up to 25 keys are not much harder, though a PCB would help.
    * Pogramable with macros, layers, supported by TODO: {TMK | QMK | Easy AVR} software
    * Numeric pads (often 17, 19, 21, or 22 keys)
    * Converting key "switch testers" to macro pads.
    * Simple, inexpensive hardware

## Initial project: 4 foot switches

My first project based on this technology is a foot-operated set of 4 (or 8)
switches. The plan is to support four modifier keys, to be foot-operated. They
are: Command (or Windows), Option, Control, and Shift.

The thought is that these could be used to support users with some hand problems.

This project will not require the manufacture of any printed circuit boards, 
and the switches will be hand-wired to the Beetle.

Parts count, and expenses are low.

Because the Beetle has 10 I/O pins available, and I only need 4 (or 8), I'll
(hand) wire then directly.

## Additional project

Again, with 10 I/O pins it is possible to do a standard keyboard scanning matrix
of 5 x 5 (up to 25 keys), or 4 x 6 (up to 24 keys, with a scan layout that more
closely matches the physical). These matrixes will require a diode at each
switch to prevent "ghosting."

For example, searching Amazon for: numeric pad USB, most numeric pads have 17,
to 22 keys on them, so the little Beetle will be quite capable for this
application.

## Load the new software


Development order for Beetle experiments (Arduino-only code)
  âˆš reset keyboard/controller after completing task
  * Compute 4-function calculator operations (say 20 different ones) in
  *floating point*, 100, 1000, 10,000 times. Time millis them and
  report. Use random numbers?
  * 
  * Create a calculator that takes character array (string) input, treats each as a keystroke. Repeat 10,000 times. Report elapse time & result.
    * example: 123+222=345
    * 1/9*9*1000/0.5+800.765=2800.76499999998
    * Maybe use PString for display: http://arduiniana.org/libraries/PString/
  * Repeat calcs and timing with "BigNumber" -- https://github.com/nickgammon/BigNumber  
    * Mac OS X calculator seems to display and retain up to 19 digits
    * Arduino LCD display is 2 x 16 characters. (We could use more and have "guard digits")
    * Sun serial (1200 baud, start, stop) by Ben Rockwood, https://github.com/benr/SunType5_ArduinoAdapter_
      SoftwareSerial sunSerial(10, 11, true); // rxpin txpin, reverse logic (yes)
