# Beetle Small Keyboards

## Overview:

Sometimes you don't need many keys for a project, and the Arduino Beetle has 10
I/O pins plus a USB port for small projects. This combination is ideal for:

    * USB based keyboards
    * Handwired (although PCB options are possible too)
    * One to 10 keys are trivial
    * Up to 25 keys are not much harder.
    * Pogramable with macros, layers, supported by TODO: software
    * Numeric pads (often 17, 19, 21, or 22 keys)
    * Converting key "switch testers" to macro pads.
    * Simple, inexpensive hardware

## Initial project: 4 foot switches

My first project based on this technology is a foot-operated set of 4 (or 8)
switches. The plan is to support four modifier keys, to be foot-operated. They
are: Command (or Windows), Option, Control, and Shift.

The thought is these could be used to support users with some hand problems.

Because the Beetle has 10 I/O pins available, and I only need 8, I'll (hand)
wire then directly.

## Additional project

Again, with 10 I/O pins it is possible to do a standard keyboard scanning matrix
of 5 x 5 (up to 25 keys), or 4 x 6 (up to 24 keys, with a scan layout that more
closely matches the physical). These matrixes will require a diode at each
switch to prevent "ghosting."

For example, searching Amazon for: numeric pad USB, most numeric pads have 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, or 22 keys on them, so the little Beetle will be quite capable
for this application.
